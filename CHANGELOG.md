## Unreleased

### Added

- `wit/runtime.wit`: the `paddock:runtime@0.1.0` app contract (`types`,
  `process`, and the `app` world).
- Tests that enforce the contract's rules: synchronous functions only, no
  `stream`/`future`, no `wasi:io` types, and an `access-denied` error on every
  capability function.
- `paddock-fixture-echo`, the smallest app implementing the `app` world.
- CI: tests on Linux, macOS and Windows, guest component checks, MSRV 1.96.0,
  cargo-deny, fmt and docs, and a weekly run against fresh dependencies.
